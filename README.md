In Realm of Disorder, players are planted in a fantasy medieval realm as a wizard. As a wizard, they will be able to move around with WASD. The player will have a special ability that can be used with the space bar. These special abilities are called spells and different spells have their own unique ability. Each use will drain the player’s stamina depending on the ability. Players have a weapon in the form of a staff which they can aim with their mouse/cursor to shoot projectiles. If the projectile hits an enemy, the enemy will be damaged (player damage will increase as the player improves their gear). Hordes/Waves of enemies (varying in level as the player survives) will be able to shoot projectiles which will damage the player if hit (enemy damage will increase as the enemies’ level increases). As enemies are defeated, the player will gain experience which will level up the player by increasing their health and stamina. Enemies may also drop gear which can be used to upgrade already owned gear which will increase the player’s damage.

The goal of the game is to last as long as possible. The longer the player survives, the more enemies that will spawn and the stronger the enemies will become. Besides enemies gaining more health and strength, more enemy types will spawn as well. Different enemy types will have different attack patterns and unique skills. After surviving for a set amount of time a boss enemy will spawn.
